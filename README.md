# BetterStatusText
A Small WoW Addon

I like the standard UI in World of Warcraft, but the new Status Text Display with both Values on the left and right side bothers me.

So I wrote this small Addon that adds a hook to the update function from the standard interface to deal with this but also gives all the information we need. Now works also with option "NONE" when hovering over the statusbars with the mouse.

Pictures:
Settings must be set to "both" to see the new string:
