# BetterStatusText
A Small WoW Addon

I like the standard UI in World of Warcraft, but the new Status Text Display with both Values on the left and right side bothers me.

So I wrote this small Addon that adds a hook to the update function from the standard interface to deal with this but also gives all the information we need.
